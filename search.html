Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.Why do we use it?It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).            sample      table                  row 1      row 1              row 2      row 2      ",

        "content": "hey, I think you need to integrate information from this same page: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/#the-data-folderthis is a good issues page: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/266IntroductionInstead of hard-coding navigation links to pages, you can use Liquid logic to retrieve a list of pages. There are two primary ways of retrieving pages:  Retrieving pages listed in a YAML data source. The YAML is either stored in a separate data file (in the _data folder) or in the page’s front matter (and accessed through site variables). Note that the pages don’t need to be YAML only (.yaml or .yml). You could also use any files ending in .json or .csv. However, the markup-less structure in YAML makes it more readable, since the spacing drives the syntax.  Retrieving pages by looping through the page front matter. You can use for loops to look through the site.pages or site.collections spaces to retrieve pages or documents that have particular properties in their front matter. For loops create longer build times, but sometimes this approach can be more efficient.Note that the techniques described here for using Liquid and YAML will be brief, since you can view the full documentation for using these formats on other sites. The focus here is on building page-based navigation for a Jekyll site.The examples that folow start with a basic navigation scenario and add more sophisticated elements to demonstrate different ways of returning the pages.In almost every scenario, you’ll see 3 elements:  YAML  Liquid  ResultScenario 1: Basic ListYou want to return a basic list of pages.YAMLYou have a data file named samplelist.yml in _data.podcast_list_title: Favorite Podcastspodcasts:- title: This Week in Tech  url: https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech- title: Radio Lab  url: http://www.radiolab.org/- title: Night Vale  url: http://www.welcometonightvale.com/Liquid&lt;h2&gt;Favorite Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;{% for item in site.data.samplelist.podcasts %}&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{item.url}}\" alt=\"{{item.title}}\"&gt;{{item.title}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;{% endfor %}&lt;/ul&gt;ResultFavorite PodcastsThis Week in TechRadio LabNight ValeWhen you use a for loop, you choose the variable of what to call the things you’re looping through. The variable you choose (in this case, item) becomes how you access the properties of each thing in the list. Dot notation is used to get each property of each thing (for example, item.url).The YAML content has two main types of formats that are relevant here:  mapping  listpodcast_list_title: My Favorite Podcasts is a mapping. You access the file with site.data.samplelist.podcasts: is a list. The list begins each item with a hyphen. Unlike with mappings, you can’t access list properties directly like you can with a mapping. If you want to access a specific item in the list, you must identify get the position in the list you want, following typical array notation. For example, site.data.samplelist.podcasts[0] would access the first item in the list.With lists, you usually don’t access positions using the [0] syntax. Instead, you use for loops to cycle through the list of items and do something with each item. With navigation menus, you’re usually insert each list item into li tags based on the navigation structure you’re building in your HTML theme.Each - indicates another item in the list. Here we list just two properties: title and url. You can list as many properties as you want for each item. The order of properties at each position in the list doesn’t matter.Sorting the listSuppose you wanted to sort the list by the title. To do this, convert the reference to the list to a variable, and then apply Liquid’s sort filter to the variable:Liquid{% assign podcasts = site.data.samplelist.podcasts | sort: 'title'  %}{% for item in podcasts %}{{item.title}}{% endfor %}ResultNight ValeRadio LabThis Week in TechThe sort property in the Liquid filter applies to the title. title is an actual property in the list. If title weren’t a property, this sorting method wouldn’t work.            See Liquid array filter for more filter options. Note that you can’t simply use  {% for item in site.data.samplelist.podcasts      sort: ‘title’ %} . You have to convert site.dat.samplelist.podcasts to a variable first using either assign or capture tags.      Scenario 2: Two-level navigation listNow let’s say you want a more robust list that incorporates heading titles and subitems. To do this, add an additional level to each list item to store this information:YAMLtoc:  - title: Group 1    subfolderitems:      - page: Thing 1        url: /thing1.html      - page: Thing 2        url: /thing2.html      - page: Thing 3        url: /thing3.html  - title: Group 2    subfolderitems:      - page: Piece 1        url: /piece1.html      - page: Piece 2        url: /piece2.html      - page: Piece 3        url: /piece3.html  - title: Group 3    subfolderitems:      - page: Widget 1        url: /widget1.html      - page: Widget 2        url: /widget2.html      - page: Widget 3        url: /widget3.htmlLiquid{% for item in site.data.samplelist.toc %}{{item.title}}{% for entry in item.subfolderitems %}{{entry.page}}{% endfor %}{% endfor %}ResultGroup 1Thing 1Thing 2Thing 3Group 2Piece 1Piece 2Piece 3Group 3Widget 1Widget 2Widget 3In this example, Group 1 is the first list item. Within that list item, its subpages are included as a property that itself contains a list. The Liquid code first looks through the first level with for item in site.data.samplelist.toc, and then looks through the second-level property with for entry in item.subfolderitems. Just as item is arbitrary, so is entry.Access the list from a page variableSuppose your sidebar will differ based on different documentation sets. You might have 3 different products on your site, and so you want 3 different sidebars — each being unique for that product.You can store the name of the sidebar list in your page front matter and then pass that value into the list dynamically.Page front matter---title: My pagesidebar: toc---Liquid{% for item in site.data.samplelist[page.sidebar] %}&lt;h3&gt;{{item.title}}&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;{% for entry in item.subfolderitems %}&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{entry.url}}\"&gt;{{entry.page}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;{% endfor %}&lt;/ul&gt;{% endfor %}ResultIn order to pass values from the page front matter into an assign variable, when the assigned variable isn’t a string but rather a data reference, you must use brackets (instead of curly braces) to refer to the front matter’s value. For more information, see Expressions and Variables in Liquid’s documentation. Brackets are used in places where dot notation can’t be used (see more details with this Stack Overflow answer.)Scenario: Apply active class selectivelyIn addition to inserting items from the YAML data file into your list, you also usually want to highlight the current link if the user is viewing that page. You do this by inserting an active class for items that match the current page URL.CSSa.active {  color: black;  font-weight: bold;  cursor: default;}LiquidResultScenario three: Conditional list{% for sec in site.data.samplelist.mypages %}{% if sec.audience == \"writers\" %}{{sec.url}}{% endif %}{% endfor %}Scenario: Separate sidebars per page  identify sidebar in page frontmatter, and pass that down to set which list gets usedScenario: Robust Multi-level menu using Navgoco  accordion, cookie, 3 level, expand/collapseloop through jsonhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/41017809/jekyll-data-people-json-arrays-reforming-and-sortingFor loop through pagessee https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/. you can do for page in site.html_pages to make the looping faster.  no access to categories variable for pagesuse the uniq tag if you’re getting a list of all pages that have a tag. https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid/filters/array-filters#uniqyou cannot do this:{% for p in site.categories.mycat %}  {{p.title}}{% endfor %}see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11887929/how-do-i-loop-through-tags-in-a-jekyll-post?rq=1basic example:The code below dynamically generates a sidebar nav of pages with\t        layout: page in the front-matter.

Links in page content remain the same across languages.The “page” or “post” content types aren’t used. Documentation content is stored in collections. Each language has its own collection:  _docs: English  _docs_ja: Japanese  _docs_de: GermanThere are also 3 config files:  _config.yml: English  _config_ja.yml: Japanese  _config_de.yml: GermanEach config file declares the collection for that language. Here’s the English _config.yml file:collections:  docs:    output: trueAnd the Japanese _config_ja.yml file:collections:  docs_ja:    output: trueAnd the German _config_de.yml file:collections:  docs_de:    output: trueDepending on the configuration file you use, the site will include only that collection. This way Japanese builds won’t contain English or German docs, nor will German builds contain Japanese or English docs.This also ensures that a permalink in an English doc won’t conflict with the same permalink in a German or Japanese doc.The sidebar and topnav should also switch to the right language as well. These sidebar receives it configuration from the page front matter.---title: Sample 1permalink: sample1.htmlsidebar: generic---The sidebar value then gets passed into sidebar.html include, which is included in the default layout:{% assign sidebar = site.data[page.sidebar] %}&lt;div class=\"productTitle\"&gt;{{sidebar.sidebarTitle}}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul id=\"docnavsidebar\" class=\"docnav\"&gt;    {% for folder in sidebar.folders %}    ...The value for topnav is likewise passed into the default layout:{% assign topnav = site.data[page.topnav] %}{% for entry in topnav.navbar_singleitems %}However, rather than specifying the topnav value in each page’s frontmatter, as is done with sidebar, this value is set as a default in the config file for that language. This is because the topnav is the same for all docs in that collection, but each collection can have multiple sidebars.Here’s the config defaults for English:    defaults:      -        scope:          path: \"\"          type: docs        values:          layout: default          topnav: topnavAnd for Japanese:defaults:  -    scope:      path: \"\"      type: docs_ja    values:      layout: default      topnav: topnav_jaAnd for German:defaults:  -    scope:      path: \"\"      type: docs_de    values:      layout: default      topnav: topnav_deUI strings also change based on the config file.
